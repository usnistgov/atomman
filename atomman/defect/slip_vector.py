def slip_vector(system_0, system_1, neighbors=None, cutoff=None):
    """
    Compute the slip vectors for all atoms.  Note that this differs from the
    original formulation in that it is not normalized by number of slipped
    neighbors.
    
        s_i = -Î£_j d_ij(t) - d_ij(0)
    
    where j is neighbor atoms of atom i, and d_ij() is vector distance between
    atoms i and j at time t.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    system_0 : atomman.system
        The base/reference system to use.
    system_1 : atomman.system
        The defect/current system to use.
    neighbors : atomman.NeighborList, optional
        The neighbor list associated with system_0 to use.  Either neighbors
        or cutoff must be given, or system_0 must have a neighbors attribute.
    cutoff : float, optional
        Cutoff distance for computing a neighbor list for system_0.  Either
        neighbors or cutoff must be given, or system_0 have a neighbors
        attribute.
    
    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The computed slip vectors.
